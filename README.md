If your a forget me sally like I am keeping, track of all our daily task can be a real struggle.
That's why I created the Task Manager, not to be confused with your computers task manager. 
But, just like your computers task manager this app will keep track of all your onging task and
allow you to create new ones as your day goes on. If your done with your task just delete it and add a new one.

and simple to use.
